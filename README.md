As part of my specialization in Python, I developed a Django project aimed at showcasing my skills in web development using the Django framework. 
The project includes essential functionalities such as user registration, login, and logout, demonstrating my proficiency in working with Django forms and authentication mechanisms.

Throughout the project, I effectively linked views, models, and URLs to create a dynamic and interactive web application. 
This application allows users to create, save, and edit articles and recipes, showcasing my ability to implement CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations within the Django MVT (Model-View-Template) architecture. 
Additionally, I integrated HTML templates to provide a user-friendly interface, highlighting my front-end development skills.

My goal is to continuously build on this project, further honing my expertise in Django and web development.
I aim to evolve this project into a fully functioning meal planner app, with the intention of eventually launching it to the market. 
This endeavor will not only sharpen my technical skills but also provide a valuable tool for users seeking to manage their meals more efficiently.
